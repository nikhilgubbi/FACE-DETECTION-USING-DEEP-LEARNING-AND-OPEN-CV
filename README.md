# FACE-DETECTION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-AND-OPEN-CV

In **python.txt** you can get to know how to execute the code once its been cloned or downloaded as a zip.

We need numpy, argparse, cv2, imutils libraries which can be installed using **pip** [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/] or **conda** [https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/]  command in anaconda prompt.

If you don't have anaconda you can get it installed from here- **[https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/]**

Following are the commands that can be used to install the libraries using pip.

* For **numpy** > pip install numpy

* For **argparse** > pip install argparse

* For **cv2** > pip install opencv-python

* For **imutils** > pip install imutils

From the above pip installation commands you can install the libraries from [https://pypi.org/]
